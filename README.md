# Static Source Code Analyzer
This program analyzes C++ source code and assigns it a score based off its accordance to five metrics. The full project report can be found above, in both .docx and .pdf formats.  

This was my Data Structures final project for Fall 2016. It was produced in collaboration with one other student (Will Kastner). 
*All data structures (array, String, hashtable, etc.) were produced from scratch by either Will or I.*

## The Metrics
* Variable Initialization
* Variable Names
* In-Line Comment Length
* Indentation
* Class Coupling
